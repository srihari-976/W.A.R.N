# Project Differentiators: Endpoint Agent vs Existing Solutions

## 1. Integrated LLM-Based Analysis
Unlike traditional endpoint security solutions that rely solely on rule-based or ML-based detection, this project uniquely integrates:

- Fine-tuned LLaMA models for security analysis
- Natural language processing of security events
- Contextual threat intelligence
- Intelligent response recommendations
- Pattern recognition through language understanding

This provides more nuanced and context-aware security analysis compared to traditional solutions.

## 2. Multi-Layer Monitoring Architecture
The project implements a unique three-tier monitoring system:

### A. File Monitor
- Real-time file system monitoring
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Suspicious activity detection
- File integrity tracking

### B. Process Monitor
- Process behavior analysis
- Resource usage tracking
- Suspicious process detection
- Process relationship mapping

### C. Network Monitor
- Connection pattern analysis
- Traffic behavior monitoring
- Suspicious connection detection
- Network activity correlation

This multi-layer approach provides more comprehensive monitoring than single-layer solutions.

## 3. Advanced Risk Assessment
The project implements a sophisticated risk scoring system that considers:

- Anomaly scores (30% weight)
- Event frequency (20% weight)
- Event severity (25% weight)
- Asset criticality (15% weight)
- User risk (10% weight)

This weighted approach provides more accurate risk assessment than binary or simple scoring systems.

## 4. Intelligent Response Orchestration
Unlike traditional solutions with fixed response actions, this project features:

- Dynamic response selection
- Priority-based response queue
- Context-aware action execution
- Response verification
- Automated recovery
