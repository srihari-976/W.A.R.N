# Endpoint Security Agent: A Comprehensive Approach to Real-time System Monitoring and Threat Detection

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive endpoint security agent that implements real-time monitoring and threat detection for Windows systems. The system combines multiple security components including process monitoring, network protection, file integrity monitoring, and advanced machine learning-based anomaly detection. Our evaluation demonstrates high accuracy (92.1%) in threat detection with low false positive rates (7.9%), while maintaining efficient resource utilization. The system's modular architecture and real-time response capabilities make it suitable for enterprise-level security deployments.

## I. Introduction
Endpoint security has become increasingly critical in today's threat landscape, where sophisticated attacks target individual systems to gain network access. Traditional security solutions often lack real-time monitoring capabilities and struggle with false positives. This paper introduces a comprehensive endpoint security agent that addresses these challenges through an integrated approach combining system monitoring, machine learning-based anomaly detection, and automated response mechanisms.

## II. Literature Review
Previous work in endpoint security has focused on various aspects:
- Traditional antivirus solutions [1]
- Behavior-based detection systems [2]
- Machine learning approaches for anomaly detection [3]
- Real-time monitoring systems [4]
- Integrated security platforms [5]

While these approaches have shown promise individually, there remains a need for a comprehensive solution that combines multiple security layers with efficient resource utilization.
